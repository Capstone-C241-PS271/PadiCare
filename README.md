<h1>PadiCare</h1> <br>
Our team came up with the idea of the PadiCare app after realizing the challenges that rice farmers face in detecting diseases that threaten their crops. We realized the urgent need for a solution that can simplify the disease detection process and help farmers protect their rice crop effectively. We focus on user-friendly design and aim to bridge the gap between technology and farmers with minimal technical skills, ensuring wide accessibility and usability of the app. Our team's commitment to supporting farmers and improving agricultural practices led us to develop PadiCare, a practical tool designed to simplify disease detection and promote sustainable agricultural practices. <br>
